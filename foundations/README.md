# Foundations

This folder contains resources that explain the core ideas behind Bitcoin and freedom technology - what problems they solve and why they matter.

Resources here focus on:
- Why Bitcoin was created
- The limitations of traditional financial systems
- Financial access, censorship resistance, and self-custody
- Why these tools are especially relevant in the Global South

This folder is intended as an on-ramp for beginners and as shared context for builders before diving into technical implementation.
